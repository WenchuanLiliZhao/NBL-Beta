          <TS time={19.200}>Many of the tales in this book were </TS>
          <TS time={21.760}>told me by one Paddy Flynn, a little </TS>
          <TS time={24.560}>bright-eyed old man, who lived in a </TS>
          <TS time={26.840}>leaky and one-roomed cabin in the village </TS>
          <TS time={29.080}>of Ballisodare, which is, he was wont to </TS>
          <TS time={32.540}>say, "the most gentle"—whereby he meant faery—"place in the whole of County Sligo."  </TS>
          <TS time={35.680}>Others hold it, however, but second to Drumcliff and Drumahair.  </TS>
          <TS time={38.620}>The first time I saw him he was </TS>
          <TS time={41.480}>cooking mushrooms for himself; the next time he </TS>
          <TS time={44.740}>was asleep under a hedge, smiling in his </TS>
          <TS time={47.520}>sleep.  </TS>
          <TS time={49.880}>He was indeed always cheerful, though I thought </TS>
          <TS time={50.200}>I could see in his eyes (swift as </TS>
          <TS time={53.700}>the eyes of a rabbit, when they peered </TS>
          <TS time={55.780}>out of their wrinkled holes) a melancholy which was well-nigh a portion of their joy; the visionary </TS>
          <TS time={57.660}>melancholy of purely instinctive natures and of all animals. </TS>
        </p>

        <p>
          <TS time={59.120}>And yet there was much in his life </TS>
          <TS time={61.200}>to depress him, for in the triple solitude </TS>
          <TS time={63.980}>of age, eccentricity, and deafness, he went about </TS>
          <TS time={67.400}>much pestered by children.  </TS>
          <TS time={69.840}>It was for this very reason perhaps that </TS>
          <TS time={71.660}>he ever recommended mirth and hopefulness.  </TS>
          <TS time={74.200}>He was fond, for instance, of telling how </TS>
          <TS time={77.160}>Collumcille cheered up his mother. "How are you to-day, mother?" said the saint. "Worse," </TS>
          <TS time={79.060}>replied the mother. "May you be worse to-morrow," said the saint. </TS>
          <TS time={81.520}>The next day Collumcille came again, and exactly the same conversation took place, but the </TS>
          <TS time={84.380}>third day the mother said, "Better, thank God." And the saint replied, "May you be better to-morrow."  </TS>
          <TS time={87.460}>He was fond too of telling how the Judge smiles at the last day alike when </TS>
          <TS time={90.460}>he rewards the good and condemns the lost to unceasing flames.  </TS>
          <TS time={92.600}>He had many strange sights to keep him </TS>
          <TS time={95.240}>cheerful or to make him sad.  </TS>
          <TS time={97.620}>I asked him had he ever seen the faeries, and got the reply, "Am I not annoyed </TS>
          <TS time={100.300}>with them?" I asked too if he had </TS>
          <TS time={101.840}>ever seen the banshee. "I have seen it," </TS>
          <TS time={104.520}>he said, "down there by the water, batting the river with its hands." </TS>
        </p>

        <p>
          <TS time={107.890}>I have copied this account of Paddy Flynn, </TS>
          <TS time={110.280}>with a few verbal alterations, from a note-book which I almost filled with his tales and sayings, </TS>
          <TS time={113.880}>shortly after seeing him. I look now at </TS>
          <TS time={116.260}>the note-book regretfully, for the blank pages at the end will never be filled up. </TS>
          <TS time={118.680}>Paddy Flynn is dead; a friend of mine </TS>
          <TS time={120.780}>gave him a large bottle of whiskey, and though </TS>
          <TS time={122.640}>a sober man at most times, the sight </TS>
          <TS time={125.380}>of so much liquor filled him with a </TS>
          <TS time={127.500}>great enthusiasm, and he lived upon it for </TS>
          <TS time={128.640}>some days and then died.  </TS>
          <TS time={131.380}>His body, worn out with old age and </TS>
          <TS time={134.940}>hard times, could not bear the drink as </TS>
          <TS time={136.600}>in his young days.  </TS>
          <TS time={138.320}>He was a great teller of tales, and unlike our common romancers, knew how to empty heaven, hell, </TS>
          <TS time={140.600}>and purgatory, faeryland and earth, to people his stories. </TS>
          <TS time={142.000}>He did not live in a shrunken world, </TS>
          <TS time={144.440}>but knew of no less ample circumstance than did Homer himself. </TS>
          <TS time={148.000}>Perhaps the Gaelic people shall by his like </TS>
          <TS time={150.440}>bring back again the ancient simplicity and amplitude of imagination. </TS>
          <TS time={154.240}>What is literature but the expression of moods by the vehicle of symbol and incident? </TS>
          <TS time={158.680}>And are there not moods which need heaven, hell, </TS>
          <TS time={161.440}>purgatory, and faeryland for their expression, no less </TS>
          <TS time={164.300}>than this dilapidated earth?  </TS>
          <TS time={165.800}>Nay, are there not moods which shall find </TS>
          <TS time={167.440}>no expression unless there be men who dare </TS>
          <TS time={171.580}>to mix heaven, hell, purgatory, and faeryland together, or even to set the heads of beasts to </TS>
          <TS time={174.400}>the bodies of men, or to thrust the </TS>
          <TS time={176.700}>souls of men into the heart of rocks? </TS>
          <TS time={179.820}>Let us go forth, the tellers of tales, </TS>
          <TS time={181.140}>and seize whatever prey the heart long for, </TS>
          <TS time={183.680}>and have no fear. Everything exists, everything is </TS>
          <TS time={185.860}>true, and the earth is only a little </TS>
          <TS time={187.860}>dust under our feet. </TS>
